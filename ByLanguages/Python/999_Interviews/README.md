# Machine Learning in Real World Problem Solving
## Objective:
The objective of this repository is to write proof of concept code for solving Real world problems using AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data science by using advance mathematical models to provide predictive modeling for solving the problems.

## Real World Problem Discussed
Let's tackle the problem of Money Laundering. Its a very big problem in the real world. Big Corporations and Institute are investing millions of dollars to prevent it. Let's see if we can us approach based on machine learn to help us write tools that can work as Anti-Money Laundering Software. 

## Concepts Used:
Data is the lifeblood of financial institutions and other organizations. It is used to run processes, manage financials, predict risk, prove compliance, target customers and influence decisions. In anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance, the data required to identify and combat financial crime is complex. It is also difficult to gather because data is often stored across a patchwork of legacy systems, new systems and siloed business-specific applications. Data quality can vary greatly. Working with unreliable, incomplete or inconsistent data makes it difficult to identify bad actors who pose a financial and reputational threat, which undermines an institutionâ€™s ability to efficiently manage risk across the enterprise.
The more complex and geographically diverse a financial institution is, the greater the threat. Institutions with very large customer databases and transaction volumes that span numerous distribution channels and counterparties face the greatest number of challenges and the most risk.

## Misc Notes:
The objective of this course is to give you a holistic understanding of machine learning, covering theory, application, and inner workings of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms.

In this series, we'll be covering linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks.

For each major algorithm that we cover, we will discuss the high level intuitions of the algorithms and how they are logically meant to work. Next, we'll apply the algorithms in code using real world data sets along with a module, such as with Scikit-Learn. Finally, we'll be diving into the inner workings of each of the algorithms by recreating them in code, from scratch, ourselves, including all of the math involved. This should give you a complete understanding of exactly how the algorithms work, how they can be tweaked, what advantages are, and what their disadvantages are.

In order to follow along with the series, I suggest you have at the very least a basic understanding of Python. If you do not, I suggest you at least follow the Python 3 Basics tutorial until the module installation with pip tutorial. If you have a basic understanding of Python, and the willingness to learn/ask questions, you will be able to follow along here with no issues. Most of the machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple, since they need to be in order to scale to large datasets. Math involved is typically linear algebra, but I will do my best to still explain all of the math. If you are confused/lost/curious about anything, ask in the comments section on YouTube, the community here, or by emailing me. You will also need Scikit-Learn and Pandas installed, along with others that we'll grab along the way.

Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This means imbuing knowledge to machines without hard-coding it.
